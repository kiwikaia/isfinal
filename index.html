        <h3>Some Background</h3>
        <p>
            This story takes place on the moon in the aftermath of a nuclear fallout on Earth. This happened because of extreme fury and war between every country in the world, all of whom decided to use atomic bombs. Severely destroying the population and leaving no choice but to escape to the moon, life started to populate again, but not without tension. Take a look at how peaceful our world is right now to see if we are in any danger of this occuring.
